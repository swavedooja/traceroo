2. Label/Tag Management
Barcode Label
● Drag-and-Drop Canvas: Users design labels by dragging elements like text boxes,
barcode fields, QR codes, and images onto a canvas representing the physical label size.
● Dynamic Fields: The designer is context-aware of the packaging hierarchy. When
designing a "Box Label," for example, the user has access to dynamic placeholders for
box-level data {BOX_ID}, parent-level data {PALLET_ID}, and child-level data
{ITEM_SERIAL_LIST}. This allows for the creation of labels that contain full genealogical
information.
● Barcode Standards: The system supports a wide range of barcode symbologies, including
Code128, EAN-13, DataMatrix, and QR Code. It has built-in support for generating GS1-
compliant barcodes (e.g., GS1-128) with the correct Application Identifiers (AIs) for data
like GTIN, Batch/Lot, and Serial Number.
● Version Control & Approval: Label templates undergo a formal lifecycle (Draft -> Review
-> Approved -> Active). All versions are stored, and an approval workflow ensures that only
validated templates are used in production
GS1-Compliant Data Elements
● When designing labels for different levels, include appropriate GS1 data as needed.
For example:
Packaging Level Mandatory Data
Elements on Label GS1 AI (for reference)

Address)
(00) SSCC, (410) Ship-toGLN, (420) Destination
Postal Code
● Default Barcode Choices: Often, certain barcode types are default for each level in
this scenario:
● Item: Use a 2D code (GS1 DataMatrix or a QR Code) since it can compactly encode
item serial, batch, etc., and is small enough to fit on a small item. If customer
engagement is needed, a QR might serve dual purpose (logistics & consumer info).
● Case/Carton: Use GS1-128 or Code128 in a larger label, encoding the SSCC and
possibly item GTIN and counts.
● Pallet: Use a large GS1-128 label (and optionally an RFID tag as well for automated
handling). The pallet label mainly carries the SSCC and maybe a human-readable
address label.
● Sample Label Data: (for Shampoo Bottle 100ML)
● Template Name: Product_Item_Label_v2
● Barcode: Code128 encoding something like {{ITEM_SKU}}-{{SERIAL}} (concatenating a
SKU code and serial number).
● Text Fields: Product name, Expiry Date (e.g. EXP 12/2025).
● Graphic: Company logo.
● Size: 50mm × 30mm label.
● Associated Level: ITEM (i.e., for each shampoo bottle).
● Status: Version 2 (Approved & Active for use).
● RFID Tag
For levels using RFID, the system provides a tag commissioning workflow typically
carried out via a handheld reader/writer (either a dedicated device or a mobile app
with a connected RFID reader):
● Initiate Commissioning: The operator selects the product (and packaging level, if
applicable) and the quantity of tags to commission. For example, commission 100
RFID tags for Item level of Shampoo Bottle batch XYZ.
● Encoding (Programming): The operator brings each blank RFID tag in range of the
writer. The system generates a unique EPC (Electronic Product Code) for that item or
packaging unit. For instance, an item-level EPC might be based on SGTIN-96 encoding
of the product’s GTIN and serial, whereas a carton might use an SSCC encoding. The
system writes this EPC onto the tag’s microchip.
● Verification: Immediately after writing, the system reads back the tag to verify the
data was written correctly and that the tag is functional. This guarantees the tag is not
faulty and contains the intended code.
● Database Association: Upon successful write and verify, the unique ID (EPC) is
recorded in the application database, linking that physical tag to the digital record of
the specific item (with its product info, batch, etc.). This is akin to “registering” the
item as having that tag.
● Physical Application: The operator affixes the now-programmed tag to the physical
item or its packaging. The system may provide on-screen placement guidelines (e.g.,
“Place the tag on the side of the bottle away from metal cap”). This step is repeated for
each item/package until the required quantity of items are tagged.
● (After this commissioning process, we have items or packages each with a unique
RFID tag ID, ready to be scanned in bulk or individually in subsequent processes.)
● 3. Barcode-Based Inventory Creation
The barcode-based workflow is a deliberate, operator-driven process designed for
environments where manual handling is standard. The process involves three key
steps:
● Serialization and Registration: The system generates a range of unique serial
numbers for a given product and batch (if not already generated during master data or
order creation). These serial numbers are stored in the database in a “pre-inventory”
state associated with that product/batch, meaning the system expects these items to
exist but hasn’t confirmed them physically yet. For example, for a production batch of
1000 Shampoo Bottle units, serials 0001 to 1000 might be reserved in advance.
● Labeling: Using the label templates defined earlier, barcode labels corresponding to
each reserved serial number are printed. Operators or automated label applicators
affix these labels to each individual product unit as it is produced or before it moves
out of the manufacturing area. Now each physical item has a barcode (with its unique
ID).
● Scanning: An operator uses a mobile app or handheld barcode scanner to perform an
initial scan of each item’s barcode. This is often done at the end of the production line
or at the point of entry into the warehouse. Scanning serves two purposes: (1) It
confirms that the label is present and readable (quality check), and (2) it transitions
the item’s status from “pre-inventory” to “active inventory” in the system, at a
specified location (for instance, Production Output Bin or Finished Goods Storage).
In our example, once a Shampoo Bottle with serial 0001 is scanned, the system marks
it as a real, available item in inventory. This step validates the physical existence of
each item and its readiness for the next stage (such as packing).
● After these steps, the individual items (Shampoo Bottle 100ML units) are now uniquely
identified, labeled, and accounted for in the inventory system. They are ready to be
picked up for packing into higher-level containers (cartons, pallets) or for direct
shipment.
●
3. Barcode-Based Inventory Creation
The barcode-based workflow is a deliberate, operator-driven process designed for environments
where manual handling is standard. The process involves three key steps :
1. Serialization and Registration: The system generates a range of unique serial numbers for a
given product and batch. These serial numbers are registered in the database in a "preinventory" state.
2. Labeling: The corresponding serialized barcode labels, generated in the previous module, are
physically applied to each individual product unit.
3. Scanning: An operator uses the mobile app to perform an initial scan of each item. This scan
confirms that the label is readable and moves the item's status from "pre-inventory" to "active
inventory" at a specified location (e.g., "Production Output Bin"). This step validates the
physical existence and readiness of the item for the next process, such as packing.
4. RFID-Based Inventory Creation
The RFID-based workflow for inventory creation is designed for higher automation and bulk
handling scenarios (e.g., scanning many items at once). It parallels the barcode flow but
leverages RFID capabilities:
 Serialization and Registration: The system allocates unique identifiers for each
item (as EPC codes, often following a standard like SGTIN for trade items). These
could be pre-generated in batches or generated on-the-fly. Similar to the barcode
case, these IDs remain in a “pending” state until verified. For example, the system
prepares EPC codes for 1000 shampoo bottles (each EPC incorporating the product
code and a unique serial).
 Tag Commissioning: This step corresponds to the commissioning process
described in the Label/Tag Management section. For each item, an RFID tag is
encoded with the item’s unique EPC. This can be done one by one or with multiple
tags if the encoder supports it. As tags are written and verified, each item’s record in
the database is updated from “pending” to “tagged” with an associated Tag ID. The
operator attaches the tag to the item immediately after writing (unless preembedded tags are used).
 Tag Detection (Initial Scan): Once the tags are on the items, an operator or an
automated RFID gate performs a scan of the items to officially bring them into
active inventory. For instance, the operator might place 50 tagged bottles in a box
and use a handheld reader to scan all tag IDs at once. The system compares the
scanned IDs with the expected list (from the registration step). All items
successfully read are moved to “active inventory” at the designated location. If any
expected tag is not read, that item can be flagged for manual check. This initial bulk
scan dramatically speeds up the inventory registration compared to scanning each
barcode individually. It not only confirms tag readability but also often captures the
items into an aggregate (if scanned in a group, the system can infer those 50 items
are now collectively in one container or location).
In summary, RFID-based item inventory creation replaces the manual scanning of each
item with a more automated scan, reducing labor. By the end of this process, all Shampoo
Bottle 100ML units have RFID tags that are registered and their existence in inventory is
confirmed. This sets the stage for packing them into cartons or moving them through the
supply chain with RFID tracking.
5. Packaging Inventory Creation (Barcode)
Once individual items are in active inventory, the next step is to aggregate them into higherlevel packaging (such as cartons, boxes, or pallets) and create inventory entries for those
packages:
 Serialization and Registration: For each packaging unit to be created (e.g., an
empty carton or pallet), the system generates a unique identifier. If following GS1
standards, this could be an SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code) for logistic units
like boxes or pallets. In our example, say we’re going to create cartons each holding
12 shampoo bottles – the system will generate a unique ID for each carton needed
(e.g., CARTON0001, CARTON0002, etc., or a serial coded into a barcode). These IDs
are stored in a pending state, similar to items, often linked to the product or order.
 Labelling: Corresponding barcode labels for each carton are printed. Each label
will typically include the carton’s unique ID in barcode form (and human-readable
form). Operators assemble the carton (place the 12 bottles inside) and then affix the
label to the carton. Now physically we have, for example, a box filled with 12 labeled
bottles and a label on the box identifying it as “Carton 0001” containing those
specific items. This step may be aided by a packing UI that lists which serials go into
which carton.
 Scanning (Packing Confirmation): After sealing the carton and labeling it, the
operator uses the scanner to confirm the contents and activate the carton in
inventory. Typically, the system will prompt the user to scan all item barcodes
going into the carton followed by the carton’s own barcode (or vice versa). For
instance, the operator scans each of the 12 bottle barcodes, then scans the carton
barcode, which tells the system “these 12 item IDs are now packed in Carton0001.”
This creates a parent-child relationship in the database (often recorded as a
packing list or aggregation event). Upon this confirmation, the system marks the
carton’s status as active inventory (e.g., location could be “Packing Zone” or ready
for shipment) with a known content of 12 items. The items inside may be
automatically updated to reflect that they are no longer loose but are inside that
carton (their location might update to the carton ID as a holding location). If any
item’s barcode doesn’t scan or is missing, the system can alert the operator to
resolve it before completing the pack.
 In cases where a large batch of items is being packed, the system might
allow uploading a list of item codes or selecting them from a list, rather than
scanning each one, but scanning is most reliable for accuracy.
After performing these steps for all needed cartons, we will have, say, 84 cartons (if we had
1000 bottles, we’d fill 83 cartons with 12 and maybe one carton with 4 remaining,
depending on exact numbers). Each carton now has its own entry in inventory with a
unique ID (barcode label) and knows which item serials it contains.
If there are higher levels (for example, pallets containing multiple cartons), the process
repeats at the next level:
 Generate a unique ID for the pallet (another code, possibly an SSCC).
 Label the pallet (print out a pallet label).
 Scan each carton on the pallet and then scan the pallet’s code to register those
cartons under that pallet.
This way, we build a hierarchical relationship: Item -> Carton -> Pallet -> etc. using
scanning steps at each aggregation.
6. Packaging Inventory Creation (RFID)
This is the analogous process to #5, but using RFID technology for cases where packaging
levels (cartons/pallets) are tracked with RFID tags instead of or in addition to barcodes:
 Serialization and Registration: The system generates unique IDs for each
packaging unit (carton, pallet) as before. These could be the same IDs that would be
in a barcode, but now will be encoded to RFID tags. For example, a pallet might get
an SSCC-based EPC code. The IDs are reserved in the system awaiting
commissioning.
 Labelling (Tag Commissioning): Rather than printing a barcode (or sometimes in
addition to a visual barcode label), an RFID tag is prepared for each packaging unit.
Using the RFID writer, the operator programs each carton’s unique ID into an RFID
tag (following perhaps the SSCC EPC encoding). The tag is then attached to the
carton or pallet. Often, smart labels are used which have both a printable barcode
and an embedded RFID inlay—so in one step, you print the human-
readable/barcode info and also encode the RFID. In our scenario, each carton gets
an RFID label encoded with its ID, and similarly pallets get RFID tags.
 Scanning (Detection & Packing Confirmation): Now, to register the packed
cartons, the operator can use an RFID reader (handheld or a fixed gate) to
scan/detect multiple tags in one go. For instance, after placing 12 tagged bottles
into an RFID-tagged carton and sealing it, the operator can simply read the carton’s
tag and all item tags inside it. Modern RFID systems can read through the
cardboard, detecting the item tags within the carton as well as the carton’s own tag.
The application will associate the read item IDs to the carton ID automatically
(since it sees them all in one “scan event”). This is effectively an aggregation event
captured via RFID without having to scan each item manually. Once the system
confirms all expected items are present in the carton (comparing the list of item IDs
against what should be there), it marks the carton as active in inventory. If any items
are missing or unreadable, the system can prompt for manual intervention (like
scanning the barcode of the missing item or replacing a faulty tag). Similarly, to
create a pallet, the operator can stack the RFID-tagged cartons on a pallet, then use
the reader to scan all tags; the system will pick up the pallet tag and all carton tags,
linking cartons to pallet. The pallet is then recorded as containing those cartons
(and by extension all the items within).
After RFID-based packaging creation, we have the hierarchy established in the system with
much faster scanning. A single RFID scan can capture a full pallet’s worth of data in
seconds. Each packaging level (carton, pallet) is now an entity in inventory with knowledge
of its children items. The inventory system at this point has a complete picture of all items
and how they are grouped.
7. Capture Events
With all items and packages identified and in the system, the solution continuously
captures events to enable end-to-end traceability. These events provide the track in trackand-trace, logging each significant change in status/location/ownership. Key types of
events include:
 Track & Trace Events (Movement and Status Changes): Every time an item or
package moves or its status changes, an event is recorded. For example: Packing
events, Shipping dispatch, In-Transit scans, Receiving, Storage, Picking for an order,
Loading onto truck, etc. Each event typically records the timestamp, location, the
IDs of items/packages involved, and the type of event. If using standards like EPCIS,
these might be captured as events like Object Event (for observing items),
Aggregation Event (for associating or disassociating parent-child relationships),
Transfer Event (ownership xfer), Transportation Event (shipping). In simpler terms,
whenever a shampoo bottle or its container is scanned at a checkpoint, the
system logs “Item X seen at Location Y at Time Z.” This builds a timeline of where
each item has been.
 Ownership Events: When the ownership of an item or a whole shipment changes,
we capture it. For instance, when the warehouse releases a batch of cartons to a
distributor, an ownership transfer event updates those items/packages to now be
owned by the distributor (and maybe location changes to “In transit” or the
distributor’s facility). This is crucial for accountability and auditing—knowing who is
responsible for the product at each stage. The system might record an event like
“Transfer of 50 cartons of Shampoo Bottle 100ML from Factory A to Distributor B on
2025-11-01 15:30 by UserXYZ”. If the items are returned or moved to a retailer,
those are additional events.
 Packing List / Aggregation Events: These events record the parent-child
relationships (which items are packed in which container). While the actual
association is made during Packaging Inventory Creation (steps 5 and 6 above),
here we emphasize storing that as an event record. For example, when 12 items
were placed in Carton 0001, the system logs an aggregation event that “Items
[ID1...ID12] aggregated into Carton0001 at time T”. Likewise, when cartons are put
on a Pallet, an event “Cartons [C1...C5] aggregated into Pallet P001”. These packing
list records allow someone later to query “what was in this carton” or “which pallet
was this item on”. They also support disassembly events if something is unpacked
(e.g., if a carton is opened and items removed, an event is logged that those items
are no longer in that carton).
 Other Events: There could be events for quality inspections (an item failed QC and
put on hold), for repacking (items moved from one carton to another), for
destruction (item disposed), or for cycle count inventory checks, etc. The system
should be flexible to log any event relevant to tracking the material’s lifecycle.
All these events are typically stored with references to the item and packaging IDs. By
querying these events, one can reconstruct the entire history of a product’s journey.
For example, a Shampoo Bottle 100ML (Serial 0001) might have a series of events:
Produced at Plant (Commissioned) → Packed into Carton0001 → Carton0001 packed onto
PalletP05 → Shipped from Plant to Dist Center (ownership to Distributor) → PalletP05
received at Dist Center (checked-in) → Carton0001 removed from Pallet for order →
Carton0001 shipped to Retailer X (ownership transfer) → Carton0001 received at Retailer X
→ Item 0001 sold (final event).
Each arrow is one or more events captured in the system.
8. Material Track and Trace Dashboard
The final piece of the solution is a dashboard that presents all this data in an accessible,
user-friendly manner. It serves both as an operational tool and an analytical/visibility tool.
 Overview Dashboard: This provides a high-level, aggregate view of the track-andtrace system’s current state and recent activity. It typically includes:
 Key Inventory Metrics: e.g., Total items produced today, Number of items
currently in each stage (in production, in warehouse, in transit, delivered),
number of active pallets/containers, etc. For instance, it might show
“Inventory: 1000 items (800 in warehouse, 200 in transit)”.
 Live Tracking Summary: Maps or charts highlighting where products are.
Perhaps a map with markers for each distribution center or transit route
where the items are presently, or a count of items by location.
 Alerts/Exceptions: If any issues have been detected (like a missing scan for
an expected item, a temperature excursion event if environment sensitive,
any item on hold), the dashboard flags them. For example, “5 items flagged
in QA hold” or “2 packages overdue in transit”.
 Recent Events Feed: A real-time feed or log of the latest events captured
(e.g., “10:32 AM: Pallet P001 departed Warehouse A for Distributor B”). This
keeps users informed of the latest movements.
 The overview likely includes filtering options (by product, batch, date range)
so a user can drill into the data they care most about. For our Shampoo
example, you might filter the dashboard to just “Shampoo Bottle 100ML” to
see stats and movements related to this product.
 Realtime Product Lifecycle (Drill-down): This feature allows users to query the
system for the full history and current status of a specific item or batch. Some key
capabilities:
 Search/Scan: The user can enter a code (or scan a barcode/RFID) for an
item or a container. The system will pull up that entity’s profile. For an item, it
might show: Product: Shampoo Bottle 100ML, Serial: 0001, Batch: XYZ, Mfg
Date: 2025-10-30, Expiry: 2027-10-30, Current Status: In Transit, Current
Owner: Distributor B, Current Location: En route to Retailer X.
 Event History Timeline: A chronological list (or visual timeline) of all events
pertaining to that item. This could be shown as a timeline chart or simply a
table:
 2025-10-30: Manufactured and serialized at Plant A (by user …)
 2025-10-30: Packed into Carton0001 (Aggregation event)
 2025-10-30: Carton0001 aggregated onto Pallet P05
 2025-11-01: Pallet P05 shipped from Plant A to Dist Center B
(Shipment event, Ownership to Distributor)
 2025-11-02: Pallet P05 received at Dist Center B (Receiving event)
 2025-11-10: Carton0001 picked for order #12345 (Disaggregation
from pallet, preparing to ship to Retailer)
 2025-11-11: Carton0001 shipped to Retailer X (Ownership transfer to
Retailer)
 2025-11-12: Carton0001 received at Retailer X store 17
 Drill into Hierarchy: The dashboard should also show relationships. If you
look up a Carton ID, it should list the items inside. If you look up an Item ID, it
should show what carton/pallet it was or is in. For example, querying
Carton0001 might show a section “Contents: Item0001, Item0002, …
Item0012 (with their statuses)” and maybe “Parent: Pallet P05”.
 Lifecycle Visualization: Some dashboards provide a graphical journey map
– for instance, a line or flow diagram showing each location the product went
through, sometimes with dates annotated, and color-coded status
(completed, in progress, etc.). This helps quickly identify if, say, something is
stuck in one stage too long.
 Real-time updates: If the item is in transit and an RFID gate scans it or an
update comes in, the dashboard for that item might update in near-real-time
to reflect “now passed checkpoint XYZ”.
Overall, the Track and Trace Dashboard consolidates the wealth of data collected (from
master data to events) into actionable information. Users like supply chain managers,
warehouse operators, or even customers (if given access) can quickly find answers to
“Where is my product? Has it been shipped? Who has it now? Did it face any issues?” all
by looking at this dashboard. The Shampoo Bottle 100ML example would allow tracing any
single bottle or batch from manufacturing through distribution to the store shelf, ensuring
transparency and quick identification of any bottleneck or issue in the supply chain.
Throughout the solution, consistency in terminology and data is maintained – the IDs
defined in master data flow through to labels/tags, which flow through to inventory records
and events, and finally surface on the dashboard. This ensures that, for example, the
carton ID a user sees on the dashboard is exactly the one that was printed on the label and
scanned in the warehouse. The end result is a robust Asset Track and Trace system that
handles everything from defining a product to monitoring its journey to the end consumer.
